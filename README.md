# Customer Analytics Data Pipeline

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end customer analytics data pipeline for an e-commerce platform, integrating batch and real-time data ingestion, transformation with dbt, orchestration with Airflow, and analytics-ready outputs. The goal is to provide actionable insights on customer behavior, sales trends, and anomalies while maintaining scalability, cost-efficiency, and data freshness.

## 2️⃣ Markdown Documentation (README.md)

### **Business Problem**

We aim to track customer behavior and sales across channels to improve revenue, retention, and operational decision-making.

### **Pipeline Architecture**

* Conceptual star schema is used to model customer, product, and order data.
* Batch data flows through cloud object storage into Snowflake via ETL tools.
* Real-time clickstream data flows through streaming pipelines into Snowflake using Snowpipe.
* ERD and pipeline architecture diagrams illustrate table relationships and data flow.

### **DBT Models**

* Models implement business logic such as top customers, sales by category, and anomaly detection.
* Incremental and view-based models allow efficient transformations while keeping raw data intact.

### **Airflow DAG**

* Orchestrates ingestion, transformation, and data quality checks.
* Includes scheduled batch ETL and streaming pipeline triggers.

### **Advanced Data Quality Check & Imputation**

* Logic includes null checks, default value imputation, and anomaly detection.
* DBT tests and SQL scripts ensure data integrity before analytics.

### **Hybrid Data Ingestion Strategy**

* Combines batch (ERP, CRM, CSV exports) and real-time (web/app events) data.
* Uses cloud-native services (AWS S3 + Glue, Azure Data Lake + Data Factory, OCI Object Storage + Data Integration).
* Ensures data freshness, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

### **10% Innovation (Crucial Step)**

* Optional AI-driven anomaly detection or predictive sales model.
* Could include automated alerts for data quality issues or real-time sales insights.

### **AI / Non-AI Tools Used**

* dbt, Snowflake, Airflow, streamlit, Python, SQL, Draw\.io
* ChatGPT / GPT prompts for generating code snippets and pipeline logic

## 4️⃣ Next Actions for You

The next steps in my project focus on implementing a hybrid data ingestion strategy that efficiently integrates both batch transactional data and real-time clickstream data into Snowflake. For batch data from legacy systems such as SQL Server, Oracle, or CSV/Excel exports, I plan to stage the data in cloud object storage—AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, or OCI Object Storage—and use ETL tools like AWS Glue, Azure Data Factory, or OCI Data Integration to transform and load the data on a nightly or hourly schedule. This approach ensures cost-effectiveness while leveraging cloud-native scalability. For real-time data from web and mobile applications, I will use streaming tools such as Kafka, AWS Kinesis, or Azure Event Hubs, with raw events landing in cloud storage or Snowflake streaming tables, optionally using dbt with Snowpipe for incremental transformations. The hybrid flow will allow real-time clicks to move through streaming pipelines into Snowflake, while batch orders are processed via scheduled ETL into staging tables. All data will then be transformed with dbt models to create analytics views and dashboards. Throughout, the focus will remain on maintaining data freshness, ensuring scalability through cloud-managed services, and optimizing costs by storing raw data in inexpensive object storage and computing only during transformation.
